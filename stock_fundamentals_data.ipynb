      "4 Min Read(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday met Wall Street’s targets for its quarterly results and forecast, though Azure cloud computing sales grew more slowly than a year earlier. Shares of Microsoft, one of the most valuable U.S. technology companies, fell 3 percent in extended trade even though earnings per share slightly beat analysts’ estimates. The stock had closed 3.3 percent higher in a broad tech rally. Azure, Microsoft’s flagship cloud product, had revenue growth of 76 percent in the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from a 98 percent surge a year earlier. Azure sales increased 76 percent in the September quarter as well. Long known for its Windows software, Microsoft has shifted its focus to the fledgling cloud market where it is battling Amazon.com Inc for dominance. The company is rapidly picking up business from the retail industry in particular, which is aiming to keep pace with the e-commerce business of Amazon. This month alone, Microsoft announced deals with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Kroger Co, on top of a five-year agreement with Walmart Inc it unveiled this summer. “Our strong commercial cloud results reflect our deep and growing partnerships with leading companies in every industry including retail, financial services, and healthcare,” Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in a statement. But Wall Street has grown accustomed to blockbuster earnings beats as companies around the globe ditch their own data centers for the cloud. “It wasn’t a blowout quarter,” said analyst Shannon Cross of Cross Research. “That’s probably playing a bit into” the stock decline. Microsoft forecast revenue of between $29.4 billion and $30.1 billion in the current quarter. Analysts were expecting  $29.9 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company also said a stronger U.S. dollar would hit growth of its intelligent cloud business segment, which includes Azure and other products, by 2 percentage points. Microsoft has long courted customers outside the United States and has a 17 percent share of the global cloud market, research firm Canalys previously said. Amazon has 32 percent. Microsoft is spending more on the latest cloud technologies to narrow the gap. Research and development expenses rose to $4.1 billion in the quarter from $3.5 billion a year earlier. “Clearly the company is spending aggressively to double down on its cloud bet, a dynamic that is a smart move but caps margin upside in the quarter,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. Microsoft’s total revenue climbed 12.3 percent to $32.47 billion. Wall Street analysts on average had expected revenue of $32.51 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue from Microsoft’s productivity software unit climbed 13 percent to $10.1 billion, powered by double-digit revenue growth for LinkedIn and Office 365. Wall Street analysts on average had expected revenue of $10.09 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Microsoft’s personal computing division, home to Windows software and still its largest by revenue, showed revenue growth of 7 percent to $13 billion, while analysts had expected $13.07 billion. The unit also includes Xbox gaming consoles, the Bing online search service and Surface laptops. Microsoft reported a profit of $8.42 billion. Excluding one-time items, it earned $1.10 per share, edging past analysts’ estimates of $1.09 per share.

      "4 Min ReadVERSAILLES, France (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron told dozens of the world’s most powerful executives on Monday that he would not follow the path of guillotined French royals and would continue to reform the French economy despite a sometimes violent popular revolt. For the second year running, Macron hosted corporate A-listers like Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella, Snapchat’s Evan Spiegel and JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon at a pre-Davos dinner at Versailles. Exactly 226 years after the decapitation of Louis XVI, who failed to plug the crown’s dismal finances and quell popular discontent over a sclerotic feudal society, Macron started his speech by invoking the king and his wife Marie-Antoinette. “If they met such an end, it is because they had given up on reforming,” Macron told the guests, according to his office. His office said earlier that foreign companies including medical products company Microport, Mars, Procter & Gamble, Cisco and others would announce investments in France totaling more than 600 million euros. The dinner was an opportunity to reassure investors of Macron’s resolve to reform the economy after images of protesters angry at his policies attacking public monuments, boutiques, banks and riot police were beamed around the world.  “There are questions about the protests’ magnitude, about the violence, because these images are shocking for foreigners,” a source at Macron’s office said before the summit. “Last year, the summit was in a totally different dynamic, it was all about ‘France is back’. Here we’re in a tougher part of the mandate domestically and that requires more explanations,” the source added.     On Monday, Macron told the business leaders the “yellow vest” movement was part of a bigger picture of middle-class angst over globalization that gave rise to Brexit in Britain, as well as the rise of populist parties in Germany or Italy. “The solution to the crisis is not to roll back what we have done in the past 18 months,” he said. Macron was elected in May 2017 against a far-right candidate on a promise to create jobs and drive growth by cutting corporate taxes, easing France’s rigid labor regulations, and developing a more skilled labor force. He began making good on those campaign pledges in a reform blitz during the first 18 months of his presidency that has impressed investors but infuriated low-paid workers, who feel he favors big business and is indifferent to their struggle to make ends meet. Over the past two months, that popular anger has been vented at protests across France. The unrest has convulsed Macron and his government and forced costly concessions.  Macron is not attending the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, his office says, so that he can deal with quelling the yellow vest uprising. Below are some of the key investment pledges announced on Monday: * Microport: 350 million euros over five years to expand a Research & Development center. * Mars: 120 million euros invested in eight different sites including the Haguenau plant where M&Ms are produced. * Procter & Gamble: 50 million euro investment in a new detergent production line at its Amiens plant. * Transpod: 20 million euro investment to finance a 3-km (1.9-mile) hyperloop test line.

      "3 Min ReadOSLO (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O), L’Oreal (OREP.PA) and Mitsubishi Electric (6503.T) are among more than 120 global firms which scored top marks in a ranking of corporate efforts to slow climate change. Many companies say they are stepping up action on climate change since almost 200 governments struck the 2015 Paris climate agreement to phase out greenhouse gas emissions this century by shifting from fossil fuels. But only two percent of 6,800 firms that submitted data made the “A List” of CDP’s index, including Johnson & Johnson(JNJ.N), Nestle (NESN.S), China Mobile [CHNMC.UL] and Microsoft (MSFT.O). London-based CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, said its data showed the shares of its index leaders tend to outperform on stock markets. Companies are coming under increasing pressure from shareholders to address climate change. CDP said the STOXX Global Climate Leaders index, based on the CDP A List, outperformed the STOXX Global 1800 of major firms by 5.4 percent a year from December 2011 to July 2018. “We think (climate action) is a lead indicator of quality in other areas, especially sustainability and management,” Dexter Galvin, global director of corporates and supply chains at CDP, told Reuters ahead of the index publication on Tuesday. Galvin said it was hard to compare the 2018 results with previous years due to changes in the questions posed. As a result, a company that dropped off the list was not necessarily performing worse, he added.     CDP asks companies to disclose their performance on climate change and separately surveys their efforts to limit water use and to protect forests in its study, which is backed by more than 650 investors with assets of $87 trillion and is meant to spur efforts to protect the planet. Galvin said CDP would in future be bolder in naming and shaming in the report, which was issued to coincide with the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Among examples of efforts made by its A List companies, CDP said Danish toy-maker LEGO launched the first LEGO elements made from plant-based plastic sourced from sugar cane. And Korean electronics company LG Display had developed and invested in more than 150 water-related reduction technologies between 2013 and 2017, it added.

      "3 Min Read(Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett has said he would love to see Apple Inc shares decline in price so he could buy more. He is getting his wish. Apple’s warning on Wednesday about weak iPhone demand in the holiday quarter due to slower sales in China sent its stock down 7.5 percent during after-hours trading. Class B shares of Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc traded down 2 percent in the same session on Wall Street. Buffett, the folksy Nebraska investor known more for buying railroads, energy firms and classic American corporate brands than for his acumen picking tech stocks, in recent years has lamented missing the boat on buying shares in U.S. technology giants. He admitted an earlier investment in IBM Corp was not one of his best. Yet Buffett has made Apple a centerpiece of his portfolio of other company’s stocks, touting his own use of the Cupertino, California-based company’s products and saying at his annual shareholders’ meeting in Omaha last May, “We would love to see Apple go down in price,” so he could buy more at a bargain. Buffett sees Apple more as a consumer stock than a tech stock, reflecting the iPhone’s status as a must-have possession for so many people. Including its after-hours drop on Wednesday, Apple’s stock market value has tumbled to below $700 billion from over $1.1 trillion at its peak in October. Although Apple has fallen behind Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in value, it remains one of Wall Street’s most widely held companies. Shares of Berkshire itself have held up well even as the broader market sank last quarter. Last year, Berkshire returned 2.8 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 4.4 percent, including reinvested dividends. But the $3 billion hit to Berkshire’s Apple shares in evening trading on Wednesday could show in future reported earnings. Those figures do not reflect any long-term gains on Berkshire’s investments, and Buffett has encouraged investors to ignore the profit statistic mandated by U.S. accounting practices.

      "3 Min ReadGENEVA (Reuters) - China and the United States are ahead of the global competition to dominate artificial intelligence (AI), according to a study by the U.N. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) published on Thursday. The study found U.S. tech giant IBM had by far the biggest AI patent portfolio, with 8,920 patents, ahead of Microsoft with 5,930 and a group of mainly Japanese tech conglomerates.   China accounted for 17 of the top 20 academic institutions involved in patenting AI and was particularly strong in the fast growing area of “deep learning” - a machine-learning technique that includes speech recognition systems. “The U.S. and China obviously have stolen a lead. They’re out in front in this area, in terms of numbers of applications, and in scientific publications,” WIPO Director-General Francis Gurry told a news conference.  U.S. President Donald Trump has accused China of stealing American innovations and technology and has slapped trade tariffs on $234 billion of Chinese goods to punish Beijing. China said in December it resolutely opposed “slanderous” accusations from the United States and other allies criticizing China for economic espionage and stealing intellectual property and company secrets. Gurry acknowledged there were accusations about China’s behavior but there was no doubt it had embraced the global intellectual property system, with the world’s largest patent office and the largest number of domestic patent applications.  “They are serious players in the field of intellectual property,” he said.  The WIPO study analyzed international patent filings, scientific publications, litigation filings and acquisition activity, and found there had been as many patent applications for AI since 2013 as in the half century since the term was coined in the 1950s. Patent applications in machine learning, which includes techniques used by ride-sharing services to minimize detours, averaged annual growth of 28 percent between 2013 and 2016, the last year for which data is available, because of an 18-month period before confidential applications are publicly disclosed. Much of that growth came from deep learning, which overtook robotics as it ballooned from 118 patent applications in 2013 to 2,399 in 2016. The single most popular AI application was computer vision, used in self-driving cars, and mentioned in 49 percent of all AI-related patents. The study showed how technology had followed science, Gurry said, with the 2013 boom in technological applications coming 10 years after a similar surge in scientific publications. However, the world did not have any reliable way of measuring the quality of patent applications. “If you did, you wouldn’t need a venture capital industry,” he said.

      "3 Min ReadSHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Search engine Bing’s outage in China last week was a technical error, rather than an intentional censorship block, a source familiar with the matter said, although Chinese authorities and Microsoft have not commented on the topic. From a technical perspective, a person at Microsoft Corp told Reuters, the site appeared to have been blocked in a manner similar to sites blocked by the government. But the company had received no prior notice from authorities, and the disruption was not intentional on the part of the government, added the person, who declined to be identified, citing the sensitivity of the matter.  Microsoft was not immediately available for comment on Monday. Last week, although it confirmed the outage, it declined to give details.  The Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond immediately to a faxed request from Reuters seeking comment. Starting from Thursday, Internet users in China attempting to access cn.bing.com, the search engine’s domestic URL, found themselves directed to an error page. Attempts to log on to Facebook, Google search, or other sites blocked by China’s Great Firewall, encountered the same fate.  Service had resumed by late on Friday, however. Engineers at ExpressVPN, a provider of virtual private network (VPN) software allowing internet users in China to access censored websites, ran tests during the outage to determine its origin.  They found that rather than domain name service (DNS) poisoning, the most common means for blocking sites under the Great Firewall, Bing’s outage appeared to employ a technique known as “black-holing”. With this method, rather than re-directing to a dummy server traffic headed for a specific website, the traffic is simply cut off en route, usually at the internet service provider (ISP) level. Express VPN Vice President Harold Li said blackholing boosts the likelihood of an accidental block, versus the more typical DNS poisoning, though he added that the company could not confirm the exact nature of the outage. “We have no idea if it was an accident or not, but it’s much easier to make the mistake of blocking Bing when you’re blocking a set of IP addresses,” he said, referring to website addresses. Bing has long been the only major overseas search engine accessible in China, which blocked access to Alphabet’s Google search platform starting in 2010. Microsoft alters Bing’s results to avoid politically sensitive topics, in line with government policy. Bing’s outage came a day after a widely read article by a Chinese journalist criticizing the quality of search results from Baidu Inc, the dominant domestic search engine. That led some internet users to speculate the two incidents were related. The company has endured regular public backlash since 2016, when a Chinese student died after seeking treatment at a hospital that advertised on Baidu.

A PwC survey of nearly 1,400 CEOs found 29 percent believe global economic growth will decline over the next 12 months. That’s six times as many who felt that way last year and the highest percentage since 2012. Many companies say they are stepping up action on climate change since almost 200 governments struck the 2015 Paris climate agreement to phase out greenhouse gas emissions this century by shifting from fossil fuels. Highlights With little time left until Britain is due to leave the European Union, the embattled Prime Minister sought to break the Brexit impasse in parliament by proposing to seek further concessions from the EU on a plan to prevent customs checks on the Irish border. Britain’s statistics agency also sought to settle another Brexit debate by declaring that was no evidence Brexit was to blame for so-called “shrinkflation” - the shrinking of product sizes. “There was no trend in the frequency of size changes over this period, which included the EU referendum,” the ONS concluded. President Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani backtracked from earlier comments that Trump pursued a business deal throughout 2016 to build a tower bearing his name in Moscow, saying his statements “were hypothetical and not based on conversations I had with the President.” Attentions are turning to 2020 race for the White House as Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is a rising star in the party and an outspoken critic of Trump, became the latest Democrat launch a presidential campaign. Eighteen years ago, at the height of the Taliban’s power in Afghanistan, Roshan Mashal secretly taught her daughters and a dozen local girls to read and write. But while Mashal’s daughters have since gained university degrees in economics and medicine, she now fears the hardline Islamist group could once again become part of the government. As talks to end Afghanistan’s war pick up momentum, women such as Mashal fear the freedoms etched out since U.S.-backed Afghan forces overthrew the Taliban in 2001 are about to slide backwards. Business Tesla said it had received quotes from Tianjin Lishen to supply batteries for its new Shanghai electric car factory but had not signed any agreement with the Chinese firm. “Tesla previously received quotes from Lishen, but did not proceed further. We have not signed any agreement of any kind with them,” the company spokeswoman said.. Ever wanted to run your electric car for free? With millions of electric cars expected on European roads over the next decade, utilities see an opportunity to sell drivers more electricity, and at the same time, offset the risk of unstable power grids stressed by the new demand. That’s why E.ON and EDF are already working with Nissan to develop services that allow power stored in electric vehicle batteries to be sold back to the grid - and now they’re trying to persuade European carmakers to follow suit. China’s broadcasting regulator approved the release of a third batch of video games after a freeze for most of last year, with industry-leader Tencent still absent from the list of new titles. Home to the world’s largest video game market, China’s 620 million players spent $37.9 billion last year mostly on mobile and PC games, according to data from gaming market researcher Newzoo.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

      "5 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - While growing up in Seattle, Enrique Rico’s mom cleaned the posh homes of Microsoft employees. When Rico tagged along on sick days from school, he dreamed of having the life of a technology worker. Now, at 26, with no college degree or background in STEM, Rico is working a developer at Avvo, an online marketplace for legal services.  He is a graduate of a program called Apprenti that provides education and on-the-job training for tech jobs to non-traditional recruits.  “I never really thought I could do it. But once I dug deep, I gave it my all,” said Rico. The Apprenti program is run by the Washington Technology Industry Association in partnership with the U.S. Department of Labor. It operates at around 50 companies nationwide with major employers including Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N). During the first year of the program in 2017, 76 candidates went through the training, which includes about 400 to 780 classroom hours on the front end, compressed into 12 weeks.  After a year of on-the-job training, the program will finish 2018 with 330 graduates placed into full-time jobs. The class of 2019 is on track to produce more than 700 graduates.  Amazon expects its apprenticeship cohort to grow from 150 to 1,000 workers in the next few years, said Tammy Thieman, a senior program manager at the ecommerce giant. The tech industry had 2.8 million openings last year, with 50 percent of them middle-level jobs that do not necessarily require a college degree, according to Jennifer Carlson, executive director of Apprenti. The pace of hiring is lagging, however, because companies cannot find properly trained workers, she said.       “This industry needed technical competency at the start - that’s a paradigm shift from traditional apprenticeships,” Carlson added. Apprenti focuses on veterans, women and under-represented minorities, screening about 2,000 candidates to find 700 candidates for 2019. Amazon teamed up with Apprenti after its CEO Jeff Bezos made a commitment in 2016 to hire 25,000 veterans and military spouses by 2021. But the apprenticeship program quickly broadened to find qualified workers for a vast swath of open jobs that required specific credentials.    “It is not at all unrealistic that freshman going to college today come out already behind,” said Amazon’s Thieman. “An apprenticeship offers a model to do the learning in a compressed way and then learn the skills on the job.  While veterans often have valuable skills, they usually do not have a conventional resume or workplace experience. That is why the biggest challenge currently for veterans is being underemployed when they leave the armed forces, said Chris Newsome, vice president of candidate aggregation at RecruitMilitary. “A lot of these men and women are able to find jobs, but not necessarily careers,” Newsome said. New college graduates often will need to complete a program like Apprenti to be job-ready because programming languages and platforms change so quickly.  Training at universities or even specialty classes at community colleges also do not quite stack up when it comes to hiring for a role such as cloud administrators which require specific certificates, Apprenti’s Carlson said.  Even boot camps for coding do not necessarily do the trick. Rico tried that route first, quitting his $16.50-an-hour job as a salesperson at an Apple Store to go into a coding program.  But without a college degree, he did not stand much of a chance against the automated interfaces most big tech companies use to sort through applicants when hiring. For smaller companies like Avvo, Apprenti is more of a mission.  “The executives saw the value of a program that gets you talented engineers and does a social good,” said Hunter Davis, director of engineering at Avvo.  The company has about 25-30 developers currently on staff, with about 15 percent of them coming through Apprenti. “They are awesome and full of grit and willing to learn,” Davis said.  The leg up for Apprenti grads starts right away. Like Rico, many were previously working minimum wage jobs, with a median income of $28,000 and most without benefits. The starting salary in the Apprenti program is $45,000 during training.  At six months when candidates begin their on-the-job training, the salary rises $51,000. If they get hired full-time - and almost all of them do - Apprenti grads make at least $75,000. That is a life-changing salary for most of the participants.  “I have an apartment and a dog and a cat,” said Rico, who is still dreaming. “I’d love to get married and have kids and buy a house. I want to be my own boss. I would love to start my own company.” Editing by Lauren Young and G CrosseAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

      "8 Min ReadTALLINN (Reuters) - Estonia’s push to become a digital society has left it vulnerable to dirty money and sanction breaches, the country’s top banking regulator has warned. The Baltic state took center stage in one of the largest-ever money laundering scandals last year - the Estonian branch of Danske Bank helped funnel money from Russia and other ex-Soviet states, a report by the Danish lender showed. Danske Bank is now being investigated in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States over the 200 billion euros ($227 billion) of suspicious payments. The Danske debacle was rooted in old school subterfuge – offshore shell companies were used to disguise where the money was coming from. But Estonia’s population of e-residents, some of whom bank in the country even though they live abroad, potentially offers a high-tech route for suspect funds. “The lesson of Danske is, I hope, enough for us,” Kilvar Kessler, the head of Estonia’s financial watchdog, the Finantsinspektsioon, told Reuters. “You onboarded customers which were offshore companies.” “Now e-residents. Exactly the same questions will be asked. Who are they? Why do they need a bank account in Estonia?” A former Soviet-occupied state on the edge of Europe, Estonia has remodeled itself as a hub for digital innovation through ‘e-Estonia’, a government-sponsored project to move almost all bureaucratic tasks, from voting to medical prescriptions, online. A key part of e-Estonia is e-residents, foreigners who have been given a digital identity card allowing them to access some online services such as government portals. It can also be a stepping stone to banking in Estonia, a member of both the European Union and the euro zone currency bloc.  Anyone can apply, including citizens of countries subject to U.S. sanctions such as Iran and North Korea. Banks including Estonia’s largest locally-owned lender LHV, as well as Sweden’s SEB Bank and Swedbank, allow e-residents to open accounts after they prove their identity and business links to Estonia. Kessler, who has the power to withdraw a lender’s license to operate, has been cautioning bankers for some time that they need to thoroughly vet e-residents before signing them on. He has stepped up his warnings since the Danske scandal. Some 50,000-plus people hold the digital identity card but there is no public data on how many also bank in Estonia.  Erki Kilu, the chief executive of LHV bank, said that while only a small number of e-residents opened a personal bank account in Estonia, the 6,000 companies registered in the country by e-residents required an account. One quarter of those bank with LHV, he told Reuters. Kilu said e-residents were subject to the same checks as other customers who lived abroad.  In an email to Reuters, he said there were also “later screening and monitoring processes”, declining to give further details. The bank does not open accounts for people or companies subject to sanctions. Ainar Leppanen, responsible for SEB’s retail banking in Estonia, said it took a cautious approach to foreign customers without “a clear link to the country”, applying additional measures such as “background checks”. He said customers were checked against international sanctions lists and described the number of e-resident customers of SEB as “insignificant”.  A spokeswoman for Swedbank said it performed “due diligence ... to ensure that their businesses have a clear connection to Estonia” before taking on e-resident customers. Some banks, however, generally steer clear.  “We don’t see a business case here right now,” said Erkki Raasuke, chief executive of Luminor, one of the largest banks in the Baltics. “The potential downside, if some of the anti-money laundering or sanctions-related risks would materialize, can be significant.” Closer scrutiny of e-residents is part of a wider effort to curb financial crime by authorities in Estonia since the Danske scandal. In addition to the e-residency program, the country’s digital pedigree — video calling company Skype was built there – and pro-business culture have made it an attractive outpost for companies working with cryptocurrencies. It typically takes just hours and an online form to open a business in Estonia and some 600 digital currency companies are registered there. “There is a money laundering risk with cryptocurrency operators. We have made it too easy for these crypto operators now. They get a reputational benefit from their link to Estonia. We get the reputational risk,” Madis Muller, Estonia’s deputy central bank governor, told Reuters. Lawmakers are considering giving police the power to scrutinize cryptocurrency companies and withdraw their licenses if executives fail a “fit and proper” test of their reputation and ability to do the job.  Under proposals before parliament, cryptocurrency companies will also be required to have a business presence in Estonia, something that many lack. “I understand that most would not be able to comply - and would not qualify to keep their license,” said Muller. National elections in early March, however, could delay such reforms, as lawmakers would have to restart negotiations if they do not sign off the rules by February 21, when they disband. Estonia’s vision of an advanced digital society open to all is a point of pride for its 1.3 million people, many of whom remember the constraints of life under Soviet rule. Azerbaijan, which also declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, became the second country to launch an e-residency program last year.  As part of its digital branding, Estonia has gifted symbolic e-residencies to Microsoft founder Bill Gates, German chancellor Angela Merkel and Pope Francis, among others. “Digital is not 100 percent secure but it is more secure than analogue,” Estonia’s president Kersti Kaljulaid told Reuters at the presidential castle, built by Russian Czar Peter I for his wife in the early 18th century. “An e-resident bank client has passed a background check.” The Estonian police vet all applicants for e-residency, checking identity documents such as passports and examining international police records to ensure the applicant has not committed crimes overseas.  The process typically takes between four and six weeks and does not require applicants to visit. Once issued, the cards can be collected at Estonian embassies. Roughly one third of e-residents come from Finland, Russia, Ukraine and Germany, according to official data that lists one e-resident in North Korea and roughly 400 in Iran. They are not named. Others come from dozens of countries around the globe from Britain to Panama.  Madis Reimand, the head of Estonia’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the arm of the police that monitors money laundering and crypto operators, said e-residents did not pose “big risks” although he said care should be taken in vetting them.  But Reimand was critical of cryptocurrencies. “We see really big threats from virtual currencies, especially threats of fraud and money laundering.” It is a far cry from 2017, when at the height of the cryptocurrency boom, the then manager of the e-residency scheme suggested Estonia to set up its own digital means of exchange, the ‘estcoin’. In the last weeks of 2018, the number of applications for e-residency slipped, according to official data.  Although the scheme is growing year-on-year, at its current pace, it would take until 2488 to reach its original goal of 10 million people, something Estonia had set its sights on when the scheme was launched roughly four years ago.

      "3 Min Read(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp’s Bing search engine was accessible for some internet users in mainland China late on Thursday, indicating that online access to the foreign technology service may have been restored within the country’s Great Firewall.

      "3 Min ReadFRANKFURT (Reuters) - German business software firm Software AG can spend 1-1.5 billion euros ($1.15 billion-$1.73 billion) on acquisitions, CEO Sanjay Brahmawar told Reuters on Thursday, as he seeks to drive growth in data integration and the industrial internet. Brahmawar, a former IBM executive who was hired last year, has launched a strategy overhaul and plans 20-30 million in net new investments this year to revitalize the 50-year-old company based in the western German city of Darmstadt. Earlier, Software AG reported a 1 percent decline in fourth-quarter revenues and flat operating profits, and guided towards weaker margins this year, sending its shares down by 7.9 percent. Sector sentiment was hit after Microsoft reported weaker cloud computing growth overnight. Software AG is revamping its middleware division to focus on integrating data applications - whether they are on a cloud server or on devices at the ‘edge’ of networks - and strengthening its Cumulocity platform that can manage automated industrial production. Brahmawar’s strategy overhaul seeks to capitalize on the trend for companies to digitalize their operations. Although growth will mainly be organically driven, Brahmawar wants to boost that with “disciplined” acquisitions. “We can raise 1 billion to 1.5 billion euros against our free cash flow,” Brahmawar said in an interview. He said he was actively looking at takeover candidates, but “it’s got to be the right opportunity”. He ruled out staff cuts after larger rival SAP said this week it would let go of more than 4 percent of its workforce as it seeks to accelerate its transition from running software on site to cloud-based servers. Brahmawar has overhauled top management and is focusing marketing efforts on North America, Germany, Britain and France, as well as Japan and China in the Asia-Pacific region. Software AG set 2019 guidance for operating margins of 28-30 percent, compared with 31.5 percent in 2018 as a whole. Its digital business platform division was forecast to achieve growth of 3-7 percent this year; the newly formed IoT division was seen surging by 75-125 percent; while its Adabas & Natural database line would shrink by up to 5 percent. Software AG will brief investors on its strategy overhaul at a capital markets day in London on Feb. 5.

      "2 Min Read(Reuters) - Plant-based meat company Beyond Meat said on Wednesday burger chain Carl’s Jr would add the firm’s vegan imitation meat to its menu, the latest big-name restaurant chain to tweak its offerings to attract vegans and vegetarians. Los Angeles-based Beyond Meat, which counts actor Leonardo Di Caprio and Microsoft Corp founder Bill Gates as investors, sells plant-based burger patties and sausages, heat-and-eat meals and non-GMO foods at grocery chains such as Amazon.com Inc’s Whole Foods Market and Kroger Co. Carl’s Jr said it would sell a meatless version of its Famous Star burger for $6.29 at most of its restaurants. Customers can also order Beyond Burger patties on any Carl’s sandwich for an additional $2. Beyond Meat, which recorded a 167 percent jump in net revenue to $56.4 million in the first nine months of 2018, filed for an initial public offering in November last year. The company uses ingredients that mimic the composition of animal-based meat, like proteins from peas, faba beans and soy that look and cook like beef or chicken. More people are shifting toward vegan or vegetarian diets, perceived to be healthier, amid growing concerns about animal welfare and the environmental impact of intensive animal farming. The company’s founder, Ethan Brown, had earlier said the U.S. plant-based meat market could mirror the growth seen by the soy and almond milk industries. Beyond Meat’s main competition, Impossible Foods, also launched burgers at more than 300 White Castle outlets in the United States in September.

      "4 Min Read(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday met Wall Street’s targets for its quarterly results and forecast, though Azure cloud computing sales grew more slowly than a year earlier. Shares of Microsoft, one of the most valuable U.S. technology companies, fell 3 percent in extended trade even though earnings per share slightly beat analysts’ estimates. The stock had closed 3.3 percent higher in a broad tech rally. Azure, Microsoft’s flagship cloud product, had revenue growth of 76 percent in the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from a 98 percent surge a year earlier. Azure sales increased 76 percent in the September quarter as well. Long known for its Windows software, Microsoft has shifted its focus to the fledgling cloud market where it is battling Amazon.com Inc for dominance. The company is rapidly picking up business from the retail industry in particular, which is aiming to keep pace with the e-commerce business of Amazon. This month alone, Microsoft announced deals with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Kroger Co, on top of a five-year agreement with Walmart Inc it unveiled this summer. “Our strong commercial cloud results reflect our deep and growing partnerships with leading companies in every industry including retail, financial services, and healthcare,” Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in a statement. But Wall Street has grown accustomed to blockbuster earnings beats as companies around the globe ditch their own data centers for the cloud. “It wasn’t a blowout quarter,” said analyst Shannon Cross of Cross Research. “That’s probably playing a bit into” the stock decline. Microsoft forecast revenue of between $29.4 billion and $30.1 billion in the current quarter. Analysts were expecting  $29.9 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company also said a stronger U.S. dollar would hit growth of its intelligent cloud business segment, which includes Azure and other products, by 2 percentage points. Microsoft has long courted customers outside the United States and has a 17 percent share of the global cloud market, research firm Canalys previously said. Amazon has 32 percent. Microsoft is spending more on the latest cloud technologies to narrow the gap. Research and development expenses rose to $4.1 billion in the quarter from $3.5 billion a year earlier. “Clearly the company is spending aggressively to double down on its cloud bet, a dynamic that is a smart move but caps margin upside in the quarter,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. Microsoft’s total revenue climbed 12.3 percent to $32.47 billion. Wall Street analysts on average had expected revenue of $32.51 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue from Microsoft’s productivity software unit climbed 13 percent to $10.1 billion, powered by double-digit revenue growth for LinkedIn and Office 365. Wall Street analysts on average had expected revenue of $10.09 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Microsoft’s personal computing division, home to Windows software and still its largest by revenue, showed revenue growth of 7 percent to $13 billion, while analysts had expected $13.07 billion. The unit also includes Xbox gaming consoles, the Bing online search service and Surface laptops. Microsoft reported a profit of $8.42 billion. Excluding one-time items, it earned $1.10 per share, edging past analysts’ estimates of $1.09 per share.

Futures pointed to a 0.8 percent opening gain for the S&P 500, with the index set to add to a 4 percent gain in the past two days, sparked by a strong jobs data and the Federal Reserve chief’s remarks that calmed worries that interest rate hikes would hurt growth. A second day of U.S.-China trade discussions in Beijing extended into Tuesday evening, a source told Reuters after officials from both sides expressed optimism. U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet that talks with China are going “very well”. “With the U.S. and China in talks to de-escalate their trade conflict, the central bank showing a willingness to slow its tightening cycle and the economy still performing well, the markets may be looking a little more attractive,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda in London, wrote in a note. The meetings are the first face-to-face talks since Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in December to a 90-day truce in a trade war. Trade-sensitive stocks such as Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc and 3M Co rose between 1.2 percent and 1.6 percent in premarket trading. Trade and concerns over slowing growth have been at the heart of a selloff at the end of 2018 that culminated in Wall Street posting its worst monthly performance in about a decade in December, driving down earnings estimate and stock valuations. The S&P 500 hit a record high on Sept. 21 before tumbling about 20 percent to a 20-month low on Christmas Eve. The index has climbed about 8.5 percent since then, with investors waiting for the fourth-quarter earnings season to kick off for a clear picture on how the trade war and a slowdown in global growth will affect profits. Analysts estimate S&P 500 companies to increase their fourth-quarter earnings per share by 15 percent. That compares with expectations of 20 percent growth three months ago, according to Refinitiv IBES data. At 8:41 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 202 points, or 0.86 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 51 points, or 0.79 percent. Amazon.com Inc was up 1.7 percent premarket, adding to Monday’s gains that helped the market power higher and the online retailer overtake Microsoft Corp to become Wall Street’s most valuable company. Microsoft was up 0.9 percent. Though Monday’s rally was led by technology and internet stocks, Samsung Electronics’ profit warning due to weak chip demand again turns the spotlight on growth in the sector after Apple Inc’s rare move to cut sales forecast. Goldman Sachs said in a note it expects semiconductor companies to face a challenging year, particularly in the first half. PG&E Corp shares fell about 10 percent after S&P Global Ratings stripped the California power utility of its investment-grade credit rating and kept it under review for a further downgrade. The shares have slumped about 22 percent since Reuters reported on Jan. 4 that the company was exploring filing for bankruptcy protection as it faces billions of dollars in claims from fatal wildfires in 2018 and 2017.

The benchmark index closed at the highest level since Dec. 12 on Wednesday after the U.S. central bank said it would be patient in raising rates further this year, pointing to a cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy. The Fed’s reassurance on rates along with heartening results from tech companies including Apple Inc and Facebook set the main U.S. indexes on track for their best month in about three years. “Right now we have positive earnings, positive economy and a positive Fed, but the only missing piece of the puzzle is trade,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “It seems as if most of the fears have been taken away except for trade, which is holding back markets. It’s still a wait-and-see approach.” U.S. President Donald Trump expressed optimism about high-level trade talks with Chinese officials in Washington but said no final deal would be made until he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the near future. The two countries opened a pivotal round of talks on Wednesday aimed at bridging deep differences over China’s intellectual property and technology transfer practices and easing a months-long tariff war. Facebook jumped 10.8 percent in premarket trading, boosting the Nasdaq futures after its quarterly profit topped analysts’ estimates, showing that digital advertisers were still flocking to spend money on the service even after a series of high profile embarrassments. General Electric Co jumped 11.3 percent after the industrial conglomerate beat estimates for sales and cash flow in the fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter earnings reports have largely exceeded market expectations so far, helping U.S. stocks recover from a December selloff that was fueled by concerns about trade disputes, rising interest rates and fears of diminishing corporate profits. After the latest Fed announcement, market expectations of future rates fell further. Contracts tied to the Fed’s policy rate continued to price in a one-in-four chance of a hike in 2019. At 8:49 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 91 points, or 0.36 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 2.75 points, or 0.10 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 14.75 points, or 0.22 percent. Set to weigh on the Dow was Microsoft Corp, which fell 2.8 percent as its Azure cloud computing sales grew at a slower pace than a year earlier, although quarterly results and forecast topped Wall Street estimates. DowDuPont Inc fell 8 percent after the chemicals maker’s revenue fell short of expectations. Tesla Inc dropped 3.4 percent after the electric carmaker missed Wall Street profit targets for the end of 2018 and announced the departure of its chief financial officer. Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc rose 2.4 percent after posting quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street targets.

      "3 Min Read(Reuters) - College education and clean water will be among the social issues that feature in commercials this Sunday, along with a spotlight on women, as advertisers seek to grab the attention of what is often the year’s largest television audience: the National Football League’s Super Bowl championship.  Kia Motors Corp  and Anheuser-Busch Inbev  are two major brands plugging social causes, such as funding for college education and clean water, which appeal to millennials - the generation of people born between 1981 and 1996, that is prized by advertisers and tends to look for companies with values, marketing experts say. Last year’s Super Bowl saw TV ad buyers choosing to spotlight social responsibility in more than a quarter of the commercials - a “remarkable” change from the previous decade when such messages made up only about 5 percent of ads, said Charles Taylor, a professor of marketing at Villanova University School of Business, adding he expects the trend to continue. This year, the average cost of a Super Bowl commercial is about $5.2 million, Taylor said. Last year 103 million people watched the event. During this weekend’s matchup between the New England Patriots and Los Angeles Rams, Microsoft Corp plans to air a 60-second commercial for its new Xbox controller designed for gamers with limited mobility. Benjamin Hordell, founding partner of digital marketing and advertising firm DXagency, called the strategy a long-term play, as “people, especially millennials ... want their brands to stand for something,” he said. “Gen Z,” or those born between 1997 and 2012, also cares about where companies stand, according to Whitney Wolfe Herd, founder and chief executive of dating app Bumble. It will air a commercial during the Super Bowl partnering with American tennis star Serena Williams. “They care about what they buy, what they do, where they go, the brands they wear, what impact that has on the world around them,” Herd told Reuters Video News in an interview. Along with Bumble, some of the buzziest of the pre-announced commercials are those with high-profile female celebrities or themes of women’s empowerment. In its first ever Super Bowl commercial, Beauty brand Olay, a unit of Procter & Gamble Co , will feature actress Sarah Michelle Gellar. Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp’s commercial will star Antoinette “Toni” Harris, a sophomore football player at East Los Angeles College in California who aspires to be the first female NFL player. While it is well known that women make up almost half of Super Bowl viewership, they have often been ignored by advertisers until recently, said Paul Caiozzo, co-founder of creative advertising agency Interesting Development. “There’s an emergence of women in leadership roles in ads, instead of being the butt of the joke or being shown in a bikini,” he said.

      "4 Min ReadVERSAILLES, France (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron told dozens of the world’s most powerful executives on Monday that he would not follow the path of guillotined French royals and would continue to reform the French economy despite a sometimes violent popular revolt. For the second year running, Macron hosted corporate A-listers like Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella, Snapchat’s Evan Spiegel and JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon at a pre-Davos dinner at Versailles. Exactly 226 years after the decapitation of Louis XVI, who failed to plug the crown’s dismal finances and quell popular discontent over a sclerotic feudal society, Macron started his speech by invoking the king and his wife Marie-Antoinette. “If they met such an end, it is because they had given up on reforming,” Macron told the guests, according to his office. His office said earlier that foreign companies including medical products company Microport, Mars, Procter & Gamble, Cisco and others would announce investments in France totaling more than 600 million euros. The dinner was an opportunity to reassure investors of Macron’s resolve to reform the economy after images of protesters angry at his policies attacking public monuments, boutiques, banks and riot police were beamed around the world.  “There are questions about the protests’ magnitude, about the violence, because these images are shocking for foreigners,” a source at Macron’s office said before the summit. “Last year, the summit was in a totally different dynamic, it was all about ‘France is back’. Here we’re in a tougher part of the mandate domestically and that requires more explanations,” the source added.     On Monday, Macron told the business leaders the “yellow vest” movement was part of a bigger picture of middle-class angst over globalization that gave rise to Brexit in Britain, as well as the rise of populist parties in Germany or Italy. “The solution to the crisis is not to roll back what we have done in the past 18 months,” he said. Macron was elected in May 2017 against a far-right candidate on a promise to create jobs and drive growth by cutting corporate taxes, easing France’s rigid labor regulations, and developing a more skilled labor force. He began making good on those campaign pledges in a reform blitz during the first 18 months of his presidency that has impressed investors but infuriated low-paid workers, who feel he favors big business and is indifferent to their struggle to make ends meet. Over the past two months, that popular anger has been vented at protests across France. The unrest has convulsed Macron and his government and forced costly concessions.  Macron is not attending the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, his office says, so that he can deal with quelling the yellow vest uprising. Below are some of the key investment pledges announced on Monday: * Microport: 350 million euros over five years to expand a Research & Development center. * Mars: 120 million euros invested in eight different sites including the Haguenau plant where M&Ms are produced. * Procter & Gamble: 50 million euro investment in a new detergent production line at its Amiens plant. * Transpod: 20 million euro investment to finance a 3-km (1.9-mile) hyperloop test line.

      "4 Min Read(Reuters) - Wall Street extended its rally into a fifth straight day on Thursday in a session of whipsaw trading as investors responded to mixed comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, while a warning from Macy’s pummeled retail stocks. Powell reiterated the views of other policymakers that the Fed would be patient about interest rate hikes. But major stock indexes temporarily moved into negative territory after Powell said the bank’s balance sheet would be “substantially smaller,”  and after he raised concerns about the size of U.S. debt. “That’s what spooked the market a little bit. It’s more of a commentary on the entire economy as a whole,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin. The S&P 500 .SPX is up over 10 percent from a 20-month low it touched around Christmas, lifted by hopes for a U.S.-Chinese trade deal, which eased some worries over the impact of the dispute on global growth. The benchmark index's five-day winning streak is its longest since September. Trade-related optimism faded somewhat as China offered little in the way of details on key issues such as forced technology transfers, intellectual property rights, tariff barriers and cyber attacks. In the United States, reports from Macy’s and American Airlines added to concerns that growth of corporate profits would slow. Macy’s Inc (M.N) stock plunged 17.69 percent and pulled down other retailers after the department store operator cut its same-store sales forecast for the full year because of weak demand during mid-December. S&P 500 companies on average are seen posting 14.5 percent growth in earnings per share as they report December-quarter results over the next few weeks, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. However, expectations for growth in 2019 are at 6.4 percent, down from an expectation of 7.3 percent on Jan 1. “It could be a good quarter, but maybe with more cautious outlooks until we get something that comes out of the trade negotiations,” said Kurt Brunner, a portfolio manager at Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia. “There is a lot of uncertainty there.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI climbed 0.51 percent to end at 24,001.92 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.45 percent to 2,596.63. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.42 percent to 6,986.07. Trade-sensitive industrial stocks .SPLRCI rose 1.44 percent, lifted by Boeing Co (BA.N), which gained 2.55 percent after the U.S. Air Force accepted its long-delayed KC-46 air tanker. American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) fell 4.13 percent after the No. 1 U.S. carrier cut its fourth-quarter profit and unit revenue forecasts. That weighed on other airline shares as well. Ten out of 11 S&P sector indexes rose, led by a 1.55 percent increase in real estate .SPLRCR, with consumer discretionary .SPLRCD ending down 0.23 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.61-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

      "4 Min Read(Reuters) - Wall Street ascended on Thursday, with the S&P 500 wrapping up its biggest monthly increase since 2015 after strong earnings from Facebook Inc added to optimism after the Federal Reserve’s dovish remarks. Facebook jumped 10.82 percent, its strongest daily rise since January 2016, after its quarterly profit topped expectations and showed that advertisers were still flocking to the social network even after a series of high-profile embarrassments. General Electric Co soared 11.65 percent after the industrial conglomerate beat estimates for quarterly sales and cash flow and said it sees industrial revenue rising modestly in 2019. Investors took heart from the Fed’s pledge on Wednesday that it would be patient in raising interest rates further this year, easing concerns about tightening financial conditions crimping economic growth. “There was a severe lack of trust in the Fed a month ago, and that has been relieved,” said Craig Callahan, chief executive officer of Icon Advisors in Denver.  Better-than-expected results from many U.S. companies reporting in recent days are also fueling optimism on Wall Street, Callahan added. The S&P 500 rose 7.9 percent in January, its best monthly performance since October 2015 and its best January since 1987. Of the 210 S&P 500 companies that have reported fourth-quarter results, 71 percent have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data.  Investors were awaiting the conclusion of the high-level talks between the United States and China, aimed at easing a six-month-old trade war that has battered financial markets.  China’s leader, Xi Jinping, told U.S. President Donald Trump in a letter that he hopes both sides will be able to meet each other halfway to reach a trade agreement before a March 1 deadline, Trump said. The S&P 500 gained 0.86 percent to end at 2,704.1 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.37 percent to 7,281.74. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.06 percent to end at 24,999.67, hurt by DowDuPont Inc.  DowDuPont dropped 9.23 percent after the chemical maker’s revenue fell short of expectations. The S&P materials sector declined 1.54 percent. The Nasdaq has gained 9.7 percent in 2019, while the Dow is up 7.2 percent. After the bell, Amazon.com Inc forecast quarterly sales below Wall Street estimates and its stock dipped 2.5 percent. The S&P communications services sector surged 3.74 percent during Thursday’s session, leading gains among the 11 major S&P sectors, thanks to Facebook, Alphabet Inc and Charter Communications Inc. Charter jumped 14.19 percent after topping quarterly revenue estimates as the cable operator attracted more customers for its internet services.  Microsoft Corp declined 1.83 percent after its Azure cloud computing sales grew at a slower pace than a year earlier, although its quarterly results and forecast topped Wall Street estimates. Intel Corp slipped 0.88 percent after the chipmaker named interim Chief Executive Officer Robert Swan to the role on a permanent basis.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.40-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, a 1.80-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 46 new highs and 24 new lows.

      "4 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) * Apple gains despite Nikkei report on production cut plans * Trade-sensitive Boeing boosts Dow * Fed officials say caution needed before more rate hikes * Slump in Constellation Brands drags on consumer staples * Indexes up: Dow 0.74 pct, S&P 0.74 pct, Nasdaq 1.11 pct (Updates to early afternoon) By Sruthi Shankar Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday, aiming for a fourth day of gains, led by technology and other trade-sensitive sectors following signs of progress in trade talks between the United States and China. Hopes of a deal between the world’s two largest economies that could avert an escalation of ongoing trade tensions, plus strong data on the U.S. job market and indications the Federal Reserve now appears to be in no rush to lift interest rates further, have helped the S&P 500 climb more than 10 percent from the 20-month low it hit around Christmas. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office said China pledged to purchase “a substantial amount” of agricultural, energy and manufactured goods and services from the United States, after talks ended in Beijing but gave no specific details. “Not that we’ve got a concrete resolution, but the headlines seem to indicate the talks went well and perhaps the two sides are putting together a draft statement, which would be positive,” said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist, Allianz Global Investors in New York. The S&P technology index rose 1.61 percent, boosted by Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and chipmakers. Apple rose 2.1 percent, springing back from a slump last week after the company cut its holiday quarter sales estimate. The gains came despite a Nikkei report on planned production cut for new iPhone models for the January-March quarter and a cut in earnings estimate by supplier Skyworks Solutions Inc . Chip stocks gained 2.80 percent, a reversal from Tuesday’s drop triggered by Samsung’s profit warning, led by Micron Technology’s 6.5 percent after Bernstein upgraded the stock to “outperform”. Shares of Boeing Co, which has a large exposure to China, were up 1.5 percent, with the S&P industrial index gaining 1.1 percent. At 1:01 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 176.18 points, or 0.74 percent, at 23,963.63. The S&P 500 was up 19.11 points, or 0.74 percent, at 2,593.52 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 76.85 points, or 1.11 percent, at 6,973.84. Financial stocks were up 0.81 percent ahead of the release of Fed’s minutes from its December meeting. In remarks that further eased market concerns over the Fed’s rate hike path, some of the central bank officials, including three voting members on its rate-setting committee, said they would be cautious about any further increases. “I do think that a more stable Fed is going to lead to more stable markets over time,” said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management in Horsham, Pennsylvania. “Some of the sharp moves in the market were driven by the fact that Fed tightening is starting to have an impact on economic growth and financial conditions.” Corona brewer Constellation Brands Inc dropped 10.6 percent after the company cut its fiscal 2019 profit outlook, , dragging down the consumer staples index. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.34-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.94-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded no new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 22 new highs and 5 new lows.

      "4 Min Read(Corrects fifth paragraph and quote in sixth paragraph to say “employment report,” not “unemployment report”) * Allergan drops as 2019 forecast misses estimates * Harley-Davidson tumbles on 4th-qtr profit miss * 3M, defense companies lead industrial stocks higher * Dow up 0.21 pct, S&P 500 down 0.16 pct, Nasdaq down 0.73 pct By Noel Randewich Jan 29 (Reuters) - Wall Street was mixed on Tuesday, with technology shares dipping ahead of Apple’s quarterly report while a rebound in 3M and other industrials elevated the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Apple slipped 0.7 percent as investors awaited the iPhone maker’s results after it warned earlier this month about soft demand in China, whose economy has been damaged by a tariff war with the United States. Interest rates were also in focus as the Federal Reserve began its two-day monetary policy meeting. After raising rates gradually last year, the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach to further tightening in the face of an overseas slowdown and market volatility. The Fed is widely expected to leave rates unchanged on Wednesday. Investors will also look to Friday’s January employment report for clues about the pace of future inflation. “It’s a day of indecision. Between earnings due out after hours today and the Fed tomorrow, and then the employment report coming up, I don’t think anyone wants to make a big bet ahead of all that news,” said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird. The S&P industrials index, which took a beating after a warning from Caterpillar’s on Monday, rebounded 1.1 percent, helped by better-than-expected reports from 3M Co and defense companies. Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Microsoft, all part of a wave of upcoming quarterly reports later this week, fell more than 2 percent each. The S&P technology index lost 0.94 percent. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies’ aggregate earnings per share to rise 14.2 percent in the fourth quarter. But with U.S. corporate tax cuts now a year old, 2019 earnings are seen rising a more moderate 5.6 percent. As Washington and Beijing officials prepare for a high-level trade meeting this week, the Justice Department leveled charges against China’s telecom giant Huawei, potentially casting a cloud on the talks. At 2:29 p.m. ET, the Dow was up 0.21 percent at 24,580.07 points, while the S&P 500 had lost 0.16 percent to 2,639.73. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.73 percent to 7,033.81. Defense contractors L3 Technologies Inc jumped 6.3 percent and Harris Corp climbed 6.7 percent after topping quarterly earnings estimates. 3M rose 1.6 percent after its fourth-quarter results topped estimates, even as the Post-It notes maker trimmed its 2019 earnings outlook, saying that a slowdown at its Chinese business was hurting revenue. Harley-Davidson Inc dropped 6.5 percent after the motorcycle maker reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, hit by declining sales in the United States. Allergan Plc fell 7.19 percent after the Botox maker forecast 2019 revenue below expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.67-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 26 new highs and 24 new lows.

      "3 Min ReadVERSAILLES, France (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron told dozens of the world’s most powerful executives on Monday that he would not follow the path of guillotined French royals and would continue to reform the French economy despite a sometimes violent popular revolt. For the second year running, Macron hosted corporate A-listers like Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella, Snapchat’s Evan Spiegel and JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon at a pre-Davos dinner at Versailles. Exactly 226 years after the decapitation of Louis XVI, who failed to plug the crown’s dismal finances and quell popular discontent over a sclerotic feudal society, Macron started his speech by invoking the king and his wife Marie-Antoinette. “If they met such an end, it is because they had given up on reforming,” Macron told the guests, according to his office. His office said earlier that foreign companies including medical products company Microport, Mars, Procter & Gamble, Cisco and others would announce investments in France totalling more than 600 million euros. The dinner was an opportunity to reassure investors of Macron’s resolve to reform the economy after images of protesters angry at his policies attacking public monuments, boutiques, banks and riot police were beamed around the world.  “There are questions about the protests’ magnitude, about the violence, because these images are shocking for foreigners,” a source at Macron’s office said before the summit. “Last year, the summit was in a totally different dynamic, it was all about ‘France is back’. Here we’re in a tougher part of the mandate domestically and that requires more explanations,” the source added.     On Monday, Macron told the business leaders the “yellow vest” movement was part of a bigger picture of middle-class angst over globalisation that gave rise to Brexit in Britain, as well as the rise of populist parties in Germany or Italy. “The solution to the crisis is not to roll back what we have done in the past 18 months,” he said. Macron was elected in May 2017 against a far-right candidate on a promise to create jobs and drive growth by cutting corporate taxes, easing France’s rigid labour regulations, and developing a more skilled labour force. He began making good on those campaign pledges in a reform blitz during the first 18 months of his presidency that has impressed investors but infuriated low-paid workers, who feel he favours big business and is indifferent to their struggle to make ends meet. Over the past two months, that popular anger has been vented at protests across France. The unrest has convulsed Macron and his government and forced costly concessions.  Macron is not attending the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, his office says, so that he can deal with quelling the yellow vest uprising.

      "3 Min ReadOSLO (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O), L’Oreal (OREP.PA) and Mitsubishi Electric (6503.T) are among more than 120 global firms which scored top marks in a ranking of corporate efforts to slow climate change. Many companies say they are stepping up action on climate change since almost 200 governments struck the 2015 Paris climate agreement to phase out greenhouse gas emissions this century by shifting from fossil fuels. But only two percent of 6,800 firms that submitted data made the “A List” of CDP’s index, including Johnson & Johnson(JNJ.N), Nestle (NESN.S), China Mobile [CHNMC.UL] and Microsoft (MSFT.O). London-based CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, said its data showed the shares of its index leaders tend to outperform on stock markets. Companies are coming under increasing pressure from shareholders to address climate change. CDP said the STOXX Global Climate Leaders index, based on the CDP A List, outperformed the STOXX Global 1800 of major firms by 5.4 percent a year from December 2011 to July 2018. “We think (climate action) is a lead indicator of quality in other areas, especially sustainability and management,” Dexter Galvin, global director of corporates and supply chains at CDP, told Reuters ahead of the index publication on Tuesday. Galvin said it was hard to compare the 2018 results with previous years due to changes in the questions posed. As a result, a company that dropped off the list was not necessarily performing worse, he added.     CDP asks companies to disclose their performance on climate change and separately surveys their efforts to limit water use and to protect forests in its study, which is backed by more than 650 investors with assets of $87 trillion and is meant to spur efforts to protect the planet. Galvin said CDP would in future be bolder in naming and shaming in the report, which was issued to coincide with the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Among examples of efforts made by its A List companies, CDP said Danish toy-maker LEGO launched the first LEGO elements made from plant-based plastic sourced from sugar cane. And Korean electronics company LG Display had developed and invested in more than 150 water-related reduction technologies between 2013 and 2017, it added.

      "3 Min Read(Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett has said he would love to see Apple Inc shares decline in price so he could buy more. He is getting his wish. Apple’s warning on Wednesday about weak iPhone demand in the holiday quarter due to slower sales in China sent its stock down 7.5 percent during after-hours trading. Class B shares of Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc traded down 2 percent in the same session on Wall Street. Buffett, the folksy Nebraska investor known more for buying railroads, energy firms and classic American corporate brands than for his acumen picking tech stocks, in recent years has lamented missing the boat on buying shares in U.S. technology giants. He admitted an earlier investment in IBM Corp was not one of his best. Yet Buffett has made Apple a centerpiece of his portfolio of other company’s stocks, touting his own use of the Cupertino, California-based company’s products and saying at his annual shareholders’ meeting in Omaha last May, “We would love to see Apple go down in price,” so he could buy more at a bargain. Buffett sees Apple more as a consumer stock than a tech stock, reflecting the iPhone’s status as a must-have possession for so many people. Including its after-hours drop on Wednesday, Apple’s stock market value has tumbled to below $700 billion from over $1.1 trillion at its peak in October. Although Apple has fallen behind Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in value, it remains one of Wall Street’s most widely held companies. Shares of Berkshire itself have held up well even as the broader market sank last quarter. Last year, Berkshire returned 2.8 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 4.4 percent, including reinvested dividends. But the $3 billion hit to Berkshire’s Apple shares in evening trading on Wednesday could show in future reported earnings. Those figures do not reflect any long-term gains on Berkshire’s investments, and Buffett has encouraged investors to ignore the profit statistic mandated by U.S. accounting practices.

      "4 Min Read* Officials optimistic as China-U.S. trade talks resume * Amazon leads consumer discretionary stocks higher * Jump in oil prices pushes energy stocks higher * PG&E shares slump on bankruptcy concerns * Indexes up: Dow 1.02 pct, S&P 1.33 pct, Nasdaq 1.69 pct (Updates to early afternoon) By Sruthi Shankar Jan 7 (Reuters) - Gains in technology and consumer discretionary stocks on Monday helped Wall Street extend Friday’s rally, with the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks easing some of the concerns that had pummeled the market in the second half of 2018. The benchmark S&P 500’s 1.3 percent advance adds to a 3.4 percent surge on Friday, when strong U.S. jobs data eased worries over economic health and the Federal Reserve calmed nerves over interest rate hikes crimping growth. Fears of a global slowdown have led to a sharp pullback in the markets over the last few months and in analysts’ estimates for corporate growth. But since hitting a 20-month low on Christmas Eve just a rounding error from levels considered to be a bear market, the S&P has now gained over 9 percent. China has the “good faith” to work with the United States to resolve trade frictions, the foreign ministry said, while U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said he saw “a very good chance that we will get a reasonable settlement” as the two countries started their first face-to-face talks since a 90-day truce was agreed in December. “The main thing is the administration’s implied progress on talks with China. That’s something that market sees as very important,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher. The biggest gain was logged by the consumer discretionary index, which jumped 2.74 percent, led by gains in Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc. Energy stocks gained 2 percent as oil prices climbed about 3 percent on support from OPEC production cuts. The technology sector gained 1.47 percent. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index, which consists of many companies dependent on China for revenue, jumped 2.76 percent. At about 1:20 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 239.90 points, or 1.02 percent, at 23,673.06. The S&P 500 was up 33.67 points, or 1.33 percent, at 2,565.61 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 113.86 points, or 1.69 percent, at 6,852.72. Utilities was the only sector down, dragged lower by PG&E Corp’s 20.7 percent slump. This followed a Reuters report that the California utility is exploring filing for bankruptcy protection as it fears a massive charge in the fourth quarter related to potential liabilities from wildfires. With earnings season around the corner, investors have almost reconciled to a slowdown in fourth-quarter profit growth, but will scrutinize forecasts for signs of further weakness. “What will concern them will be the forecast, those will be critical to whether just producing a good bottom line number is enough for investors,” Meckler said. Analysts now estimate fourth-quarter profit growth at S&P 500 companies at about 15 percent, flat from a year earlier. That is lower than the 20 percent growth expected in early October, according to Refinitiv IBES data. The estimate for 2019 profit growth has fallen to about 7 percent from 10 percent. Microsoft Corp advanced about 1.2 percent, while Amazon gained 3.1 percent as the two companies vied to become the U.S. company with the largest market capitalization. Dollar Tree Inc jumped 6.3 percent after activist investor Starboard Value LP called on the retailer to sell its underperforming Family Dollar business and proposed replacing a majority of its board. Loxo Oncology Inc surged 65.8 percent after Eli Lilly and Co said it would buy the cancer drug developer for about $8 billion. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.23-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.61-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded no new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 25 new highs and 11 new lows.

      "4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street gained ground on Friday in a broad-based rally as investors were heartened by news that Washington would move to temporarily end the longest U.S. government shutdown in history. All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced, with the Dow and the Nasdaq eking out their fifth straight weekly gains. But the S&P 500 posted its first weekly loss of the year, snapping a four-week run. The indexes backed off their highs after President Donald Trump confirmed he and lawmakers agreed to advance a three-week stop-gap spending plan to reopen the government. Investor sentiment had faltered in recent days in the face of revived jitters related to the shutdown and the prolonged U.S.-China tariff spat.  “As some of these uncertainties in the market start to diminish we’ll get a clearer picture as to where things are headed,” said Charlie Ripley, senior market strategist for Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis. “And today’s news of the ending of the government shutdown certainly alleviates some of that overhang.” “But most likely some uncertainty will linger as this is only a temporary measure to fund the government for now,” Ripley added.  Among these uncertainties, the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China continues to worry investors.  With the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, nearing its conclusion, business leaders have expressed worries over the tariff battles, saying they are “fed up” with Trump’s policies. An escalation of the U.S.-China trade war would sharpen the global economic slowdown already under way, according to a Reuters poll of hundreds of economists worldwide. Fourth-quarter corporate earnings season is in high gear, with more than 22 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported. Of those, 72.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations. Earnings on Friday were a mixed bag.  Starbucks Corp also surpassed Wall Street consensus, reporting better-than-anticipated quarterly sales. The coffee chain’s shares advanced 3.6 percent. Consumer products company Colgate-Palmolive Co reported fourth-quarter revenue that surprised to the upside but said it expects profit to decline in 2019. Its stock edged down 0.6 percent.  Intel Corp shares dropped 5.5 percent following the chipmaker’s disappointing fourth-quarter sales and current-quarter forecasts. Still, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index ended the session up 2.2 percent in the wake of a spate of positive earnings from other chipmakers.      DR Horton Inc’s quarterly results fell short of analyst expectations, underscoring persistent weakness in the U.S. housing market. The homebuilder’s shares fell 2.6 percent.  Western Digital Corp also disappointed, but its closed 7.5 percent higher after providing an upbeat forecast and saying it was committed to paying dividends. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 183.96 points, or 0.75 percent, to 24,737.2, the S&P 500 gained 22.43 points, or 0.85 percent, to 2,664.76 and the Nasdaq Composite added 91.40 points, or 1.29 percent, to 7,164.86. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.41-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.56-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 20 new lows.

      "4 Min Read(Reuters) - The S&P 500 jumped to a three-week high on Tuesday, led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and industrial shares on bets that the United States and China would strike a deal to end their trade war. The three-day rally kicked off on Friday following robust U.S. jobs data and dovish comments on interest rates by Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell has lifted the S&P 500 .SPX by over 9 percent from 20-month lows touched around Christmas. The S&P 500 has gained in seven of the past nine sessions. The United States and China will extend trade talks in Beijing for an unscheduled third day, a member of the U.S. delegation said, as the world’s two largest economies looked to resolve their bitter trade dispute. So far, officials from both sides have sounded optimistic, with President Donald Trump saying talks were going well. “You’re seeing some negotiations happen and the market is starting to think that perhaps we’ll start to see a framework evolve,” said Anik Sen, global head of equities at PineBridge Investments. The trade-sensitive S&P industrials sector .SPLRCI rose 1.41 percent. Boeing Co (BA.N) shares jumped 3.79 percent, contributing the most to the Dow’s rise, after the company said it had delivered a record 806 aircraft in 2018. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) rose 1.91 percent, regaining some ground after the company last week warned of weaker-than-expected demand for its iPhones. But tech sector gains were limited by a drop in chip stocks after Samsung (005930.KS) blamed an estimated 29 percent drop in quarterly profit on weak chip demand. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX slid 0.49 percent. Adding to the woes, Goldman Sachs forecast a tough year for chipmakers, particularly in the first half. Other investors remained upbeat about upcoming U.S. quarterly results.  “It’s the new year and investors are really stepping back and taking a look at the fundamentals, and realizing it’s not as bad a story as maybe we thought toward the end of the year,” said Jeff Kravetz, a regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. The communication services index .SPLRCL climbed 1.58 percent, with Facebook Inc (FB.O) adding 3.25 percent after JPMorgan said the social media company was among its favourite internet picks for 2019. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) rose 1.66 percent, increasing its market capitalization to $810 billion and cementing its position as the most valuable U.S. company. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI jumped 1.09 percent to end at 23,787.45 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.97 percent to 2,574.41. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 1.08 percent to 6,897.00. Financials .SPSY was the only S&P index not to gain, ending unchanged as the U.S. Treasury yield curve US2US10=TWEB flattened. PG&E Corp (PCG.N) shares continued to decline, falling 7.34 percent after S&P Global Ratings stripped the California power utility of its investment-grade credit rating. Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) rose 8.73 percent after the No. 1 U.S. railroad named industry veteran Jim Vena as chief operating officer. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.16-to-1 ratio favoured advancers.

      "4 Min Read(Reuters) - Wall Street extended its rally into a fifth straight day on Thursday in a session of whipsaw trading as investors responded to mixed comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, while a warning from Macy’s pummeled retail stocks. Powell reiterated the views of other policymakers that the Fed would be patient about interest rate hikes. But major stock indexes temporarily moved into negative territory after Powell said the bank’s balance sheet would be “substantially smaller,”  and after he raised concerns about the size of U.S. debt. “That’s what spooked the market a little bit. It’s more of a commentary on the entire economy as a whole,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin. The S&P 500 .SPX is up over 10 percent from a 20-month low it touched around Christmas, lifted by hopes for a U.S.-Chinese trade deal, which eased some worries over the impact of the dispute on global growth. The benchmark index's five-day winning streak is its longest since September. Trade-related optimism faded somewhat as China offered little in the way of details on key issues such as forced technology transfers, intellectual property rights, tariff barriers and cyber attacks. In the United States, reports from Macy’s and American Airlines added to concerns that growth of corporate profits would slow. Macy’s Inc (M.N) stock plunged 17.69 percent and pulled down other retailers after the department store operator cut its same-store sales forecast for the full year because of weak demand during mid-December. S&P 500 companies on average are seen posting 14.5 percent growth in earnings per share as they report December-quarter results over the next few weeks, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. However, expectations for growth in 2019 are at 6.4 percent, down from an expectation of 7.3 percent on Jan 1. “It could be a good quarter, but maybe with more cautious outlooks until we get something that comes out of the trade negotiations,” said Kurt Brunner, a portfolio manager at Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia. “There is a lot of uncertainty there.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI climbed 0.51 percent to end at 24,001.92 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.45 percent to 2,596.63. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.42 percent to 6,986.07. Trade-sensitive industrial stocks .SPLRCI rose 1.44 percent, lifted by Boeing Co (BA.N), which gained 2.55 percent after the U.S. Air Force accepted its long-delayed KC-46 air tanker. American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) fell 4.13 percent after the No. 1 U.S. carrier cut its fourth-quarter profit and unit revenue forecasts. That weighed on other airline shares as well. Ten out of 11 S&P sector indexes rose, led by a 1.55 percent increase in real estate .SPLRCR, with consumer discretionary .SPLRCD ending down 0.23 percent.

      "5 Min Read(Reuters) - Wall Street rallied for a fourth session on Wednesday, propelled by Apple, chipmakers and other trade-sensitive stocks after signs of progress in trade talks between the United States and China. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX, now in its longest daily winning streak in nearly four months, is up about 10 percent from a 20-month low it touched around Christmas, lifted by hopes for a deal between the world's two largest economies, which eased some worries over the impact of the trade spat on global growth.  Market participants were also encouraged by strong U.S. jobs data and recent indications the U.S. Federal Reserve is in no rush to raise interest rates.  The Fed released minutes showing a range of policymakers said in December they could be patient about future interest rate increases and that a few did not support the central bank’s rate increase that month. China pledged to purchase “a substantial amount” of agricultural, energy and manufactured goods and services from the United States, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office said, as talks wrapped up in Beijing. The S&P technology index .SPLRCT rose 1.50 percent, with   Apple Inc (AAPL.O) up 1.70 percent despite a Nikkei report that the company had reduced planned production for its three new iPhone models for the January-March quarter. The company’s shares tumbled about 10 percent last week after it warned on holiday quarter sales. Its suppliers, which largely include chipmakers, took another beating on Tuesday after Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) flagged weak chip demand. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX gained 2.52 percent. Chipmakers are among the U.S. multinationals with the highest revenue exposure to China. “If you want to gauge how investors are viewing the trade talks, just watch tech, and semiconductors in particular,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. Shares of Boeing Co (BA.N), which also has a large exposure to China, climbed 0.97 percent, with the S&P industrial index .SPLRCI gaining 0.63 percent.  The energy index .SPNY led other sectors with a 1.50 percent jump, helped by oil prices at their highest levels in nearly a month.  The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, often referred to as an investor fear gauge, dropped half-a-point to a one-month low of 19.85. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 0.39 percent to finish at 23,879.12 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.41 percent to 2,584.96. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.87 percent to 6,957.08. Financial stocks .SPSY rose 0.52 percent, with Citigroup (C.N) climbing 2 percent. Echoing the Fed minutes released on Wednesday, many policymakers said they could wait on any further interest rate hikes until they had a better handle on whether growing risks will undercut an otherwise solid U.S. economic outlook. “A more stable Fed is going to lead to more stable markets over time,” said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management in Horsham, Pennsylvania. “Some of the sharp moves in the market were driven by the fact that Fed tightening is starting to have an impact on economic growth and financial conditions.” For the S&P, Wednesday’s advance marked the benchmark index’s longest streak of gains since mid-September, just before it started retreating from its record high.  Shares in Constellation Brands Inc (STZ.N) sank 12.42 percent, dragging down the consumer staples index .SPLRCS, after the Corona brewer cut its fiscal 2019 profit outlook. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.91-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 5 new lows.

      "4 Min Read(Reuters) - The S&P 500 was set to open flat on Thursday following the Federal Reserve’s pledge to be patient on further interest rate hikes and stellar results from Facebook Inc, as anxious investors awaited the outcome of the U.S.-China trade talks. The benchmark index closed at the highest level since Dec. 12 on Wednesday after the U.S. central bank said it would be patient in raising rates further this year, pointing to a cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy. The Fed’s reassurance on rates along with heartening results from tech companies including Apple Inc and Facebook set the main U.S. indexes on track for their best month in about three years. “Right now we have positive earnings, positive economy and a positive Fed, but the only missing piece of the puzzle is trade,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “It seems as if most of the fears have been taken away except for trade, which is holding back markets. It’s still a wait-and-see approach.” U.S. President Donald Trump expressed optimism about high-level trade talks with Chinese officials in Washington but said no final deal would be made until he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the near future. The two countries opened a pivotal round of talks on Wednesday aimed at bridging deep differences over China’s intellectual property and technology transfer practices and easing a months-long tariff war. Facebook jumped 10.8 percent in premarket trading, boosting the Nasdaq futures after its quarterly profit topped analysts’ estimates, showing that digital advertisers were still flocking to spend money on the service even after a series of high profile embarrassments. General Electric Co jumped 11.3 percent after the industrial conglomerate beat estimates for sales and cash flow in the fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter earnings reports have largely exceeded market expectations so far, helping U.S. stocks recover from a December selloff that was fueled by concerns about trade disputes, rising interest rates and fears of diminishing corporate profits. After the latest Fed announcement, market expectations of future rates fell further. Contracts tied to the Fed’s policy rate continued to price in a one-in-four chance of a hike in 2019.     At 8:49 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 91 points, or 0.36 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 2.75 points, or 0.10 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 14.75 points, or 0.22 percent. Set to weigh on the Dow was Microsoft Corp, which fell 2.8 percent as its Azure cloud computing sales grew at a slower pace than a year earlier, although quarterly results and forecast topped Wall Street estimates. DowDuPont Inc fell 8 percent after the chemicals maker’s revenue fell short of expectations. Tesla Inc dropped 3.4 percent after the electric carmaker missed Wall Street profit targets for the end of 2018 and announced the departure of its chief financial officer. Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc rose 2.4 percent after posting quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street targets.

      "9 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.  AND SO BEGINS THE PAUSE The U.S. Federal Reserve convenes its first monetary policy meeting of 2019 after hiking rates for a fifth time in as many quarters in December. But while it has forecast two more hikes for 2019, the darkening global economic outlook, convulsing stock markets and a record-long government shutdown are clouding the policy picture. Now, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is preaching “patience” with regard to future rate increases, and he’s been joined by two other governors and all 12 Fed regional bank presidents. But what happens after such a pause? Interest rate futures markets currently assign a roughly 20 percent probability for a move above the current 2.25-2.50 percent range for the fed funds target rate at any 2019 meeting. A year from now, a rate cut is almost as probable as a rate hike. Most previous Fed pauses are associated with the end of a cycle and followed by a change in policy direction. Yet the current tightening cycle and previous two easing phases have featured mid-cycle pauses. So how rare would a rate hike resumption be after this newest holding period? In both the 2000-2003 and 2007-2009 cutting cycles, the Fed took at least one hiatus of six months or longer and resumed cuts later. In the present one, they’ve managed extended pauses twice since this cycle’s first December 2015 hike. A full year lapsed between the first and second hike; six months between hikes four and five.  OH CHINA, WHERE ART THOU? Alarm bells from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are still ringing in investors’ ears, after the Fund cut global growth forecasts, warning in particular that failure to resolve trade tensions could further destabilise the world economy. So markets will focus on Chinese manufacturing data due on Thursday and Friday to glean how the world’s number two economy is faring. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will also head to the United States on Wednesday and Thursday - with a 30-member delegation - for the next round of trade negotiations. There are reasons to be hopeful of some kind of agreement even if U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the two sides were “miles and miles” from resolving their trade issues. He did after all admit there was a fair chance of a deal, eventually. So far there is little clarity on how bad it could get, for China’s and for the world economy and how much stimulus Beijing may be happy to provide this time round. China’s obsession with market stability and the quality of credit growth adds to that challenge. Another week, another vote. On Jan 29, Britain’s parliament will debate Prime Minister Theresa May’s proposed next Brexit steps as well as alternative plans put forward by lawmakers, including some that seek to delay Britain’s March 29 exit from the EU. Parliament won’t be asked to vote to approve a revised Brexit deal and given the crushing margin by which May’s ‘plan A’ was defeated just a week ago, that’s just as well. Greater focus though is on averting a No-deal Brexit - a scenario in which the UK crashes out of the EU with no trade agreement. That looks achievable. The opposition and many ruling party members will likely back an amendment providing for a nine-month extension to Brexit should a deal not be agreed by Feb. 26. Meanwhile warnings against no-deal Brexit are coming in thick and fast from finance minister Philip Hammond as well as companies such as Ford, Jaguar-Land Rover, Goldman Sachs and Airbus. Markets are trading accordingly - sterling has just has enjoyed its best week since Sept 2017 against the dollar. Analysts reckon if May’s deal or the amendment delaying Brexit pass, sterling could rally another 5-10 percent. That may sound overly optimistic, given the challenges the UK economy will still face. Risks are finely balanced though: Remember, investors have taken off some option hedges they had put on to guard against sterling downside. If the possibility of no-deal raises its head again, they may have to scurry back to safety.   TORRID TECH TIMES? Results from Apple (AAPL.O) on Tuesday and Microsoft (MSFT.O) on Wednesday will be high on the agenda as global tech struggles to recover from a tumultuous end of 2018 that saw tumbling shares and sharp downgrades to earnings expectations. The updates from the two U.S. giants follows a string of dour numbers from chipmakers across the globe, signaling more gloom in coming months for the once-high-flying sector. A slowdown in China is one of the top risks with firms ranging from South Korea’s SK Hynix (000660.KS) to Texas Instruments (TXN.O) flagging weakness in the world’s second largest economy as a bitter trade war with Washington rages on. In the past two years, earnings growth exceeded 15 percent. Now expectations for 2019 growth in global tech have plunged to less than 2 percent from more than 10 percent seen a few months ago, illustrating the woes facing the industry. But there’s also a glimmer of hope. An upbeat forecast from chipmaker STMicro (STM.MI) for the second half gave a boost to a sector where a lot of negativity has already been priced in and less demanding valuations provide a cushion to selling pressure.  Venezuela is likely to stay in the headlines, given opposition leader Juan Guaido has declared himself interim head of state in the Latin American country and received swift backing from many of his compatriots, the United States, Canada and several Latin American governments, including Brazil and Colombia. Many in Venezuela, ruled by President Nicolas Maduro since 2013, will be hoping a power handover of some kind may lift the country out of its worst ever economic crisis. Despite the world’s largest crude reserves, its population is suffering from food and medicine shortages; hyperinflation could reach 10 million percent this year. The events have also lifted prices in defaulted debt issued by the government and state oil company PDVSA, with many bondholders hoping they will see payday sooner than they had expected. Oil prices too inched higher on signs U.S. sanctions against Maduro may further cut Venezuelan crude output But if Washington and the West are backing Guaido, Maduro too has his supporters, Russia in particular. It has offered to mediate between him and Guaido and slammed what it called U.S. efforts to effect regime change in Venezuela.

      "7 Min Read(Reuters) - In October, 31 Chinese teenagers reported to the Beijing Institute of Technology, one of the country’s premier military research establishments. Selected from more than 5000 applicants, Chinese authorities hope they will design a new generation of artificial intelligent weapons systems that could range from microscopic robots to computer worms, submarines, drones and tanks. The program is a potent reminder of what could be the defining arms race of the century, as greater computing power and self-learning programs create new avenues for war and statecraft. It is an area in which technology may now be outstripping strategic, ethical and policy thinking – but also where the battle for raw human talent may be just as important as getting the computer hardware, software and programming right. Consultancy PwC estimates that by 2030 artificial intelligence products and systems will contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy, with China and the United States likely the two leading nations. But it is the potential military consequences that have governments most worried, fearful of falling behind – but also nervous that untested technology could bring new dangers. In the United States, Pentagon chiefs have asked the Defense Innovation Board – a collection of senior Silicon Valley figures who provide the U.S. military with tech advice – to come up with a set of ethical principles for the use of artificial intelligence in war. Last month, France and Canada announced they were setting up an international panel to discuss broadly similar questions. So far, Western states have stuck to the belief that decisions of life and death in conflict should always be made by humans, with computers and algorithms simply supporting those decisions. Other nations – particularly Russia and China – are flirting with a different path. Russia – which last year announced it was doubling AI investment – said this month it would publish a new AI national strategy “roadmap” by mid-2019. Russian officials say they see AI as a key to dominating cyberspace and information operations, with suspected Russian online “troll farms” thought to already be using automated social media feeds to push disinformation. Beijing is seen as even further ahead in developing AI, to the extent some experts believe it may already be beating the United States. Experts say achieving mastery in AI comes down to having sufficient computer power, enough data to learn from, and the human talent to make those systems work. As the world’s most powerful autocratic states, Russia and China have that capability and intent, both to use AI to maintain government dominance at home and beat enemies beyond. Already, Beijing is using mass automatic surveillance – including facial recognition software – to crack down on dissent, particularly in its ethnic Uighur Muslim northwest. Along with Russia, China has many fewer scruples and controls than Western states when it comes to monitoring its citizens’ communications. Such systems will likely become more powerful as technology improves.  Traditionally, Western democracies – particularly America – have proved more adept than dictatorships at tapping new technology and innovation. On AI, however, Washington’s efforts to build links between Silicon Valley and the military have been far from trouble-free. In June, employees at Google forced the firm to avoid renewing its contract with the Pentagon. Many tech researchers are reluctant to work on defense projects, nervous they will end up building out-of-control robots that kill. The United States and its allies are still researching and building their own autonomous weapons. In October, Microsoft quietly announced it intended to sell the Pentagon whatever advanced AI systems it needed to “build a strong defense.” U.S. Air Force leaders say its highly classified future long-range strike aircraft, designed to replace the B-2 stealth bomber, will be able to operate both with and without crew. Western militaries are also plowing growing resources into unmanned trucks and other supply vehicles, hoping to perform many more “dirty, dull and dangerous” battlefield tasks without risking human personnel. These dynamics will become much more complex with the growing use of drone swarms, in which multiple unmanned vehicles control themselves. When it comes to drones fighting drones, Western policymakers are generally happy to let unmanned systems make their own decisions. But when it comes to killing, Defense Department policy requires that a human must remain “in the loop.” That may become ever harder to manage, however – particularly if an enemy’s automated systems are making such judgments at much faster than human speed. By the early 2020s, Chinese scientists expect to be operating large unmanned and potentially armed submarines in the world’s oceans, aimed at enemy forces in disputed areas such as the South China Sea. Such vessels could potentially travel vast distances and remain concealed for long periods of time – China says a prototype drone “underwater glider” completed a record 141-day, 3,619-km voyage last month. For now, Chinese researchers say any decision for such vessels to conduct attacks would still be made by human commanders – but that may not always remain the case. In January last year, the Pentagon reported Russia was building and looking to operate its own large nuclear-powered unmanned submarines, likely capable of carrying nuclear weapons. Both Moscow and Beijing are also prioritizing unmanned robot tanks, with Russia testing its latest version on the ground in Syria. Such systems could dramatically complicate battlefield targeting decisions for Western commanders in any conflict, making it unclear whether individual vehicles or vessels contained human beings. Mistakes could start or dramatically escalate wars. In recruiting their 31 teenagers for the Beijing Institute of Technology, those managing selection reportedly looked for “willingness to fight.” With technology this untested – and so potentially destructive – that may prove a very dangerous trait to prioritize.

      "8 Min ReadTALLINN (Reuters) - Estonia’s push to become a digital society has left it vulnerable to dirty money and sanction breaches, the country’s top banking regulator has warned. The Baltic state took center stage in one of the largest-ever money laundering scandals last year - the Estonian branch of Danske Bank helped funnel money from Russia and other ex-Soviet states, a report by the Danish lender showed. Danske Bank is now being investigated in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States over the 200 billion euros ($227 billion) of suspicious payments. The Danske debacle was rooted in old school subterfuge – offshore shell companies were used to disguise where the money was coming from. But Estonia’s population of e-residents, some of whom bank in the country even though they live abroad, potentially offers a high-tech route for suspect funds. “The lesson of Danske is, I hope, enough for us,” Kilvar Kessler, the head of Estonia’s financial watchdog, the Finantsinspektsioon, told Reuters. “You onboarded customers which were offshore companies.” “Now e-residents. Exactly the same questions will be asked. Who are they? Why do they need a bank account in Estonia?” A former Soviet-occupied state on the edge of Europe, Estonia has remodeled itself as a hub for digital innovation through ‘e-Estonia’, a government-sponsored project to move almost all bureaucratic tasks, from voting to medical prescriptions, online. A key part of e-Estonia is e-residents, foreigners who have been given a digital identity card allowing them to access some online services such as government portals. It can also be a stepping stone to banking in Estonia, a member of both the European Union and the euro zone currency bloc.  Anyone can apply, including citizens of countries subject to U.S. sanctions such as Iran and North Korea. Banks including Estonia’s largest locally-owned lender LHV, as well as Sweden’s SEB Bank and Swedbank, allow e-residents to open accounts after they prove their identity and business links to Estonia. Kessler, who has the power to withdraw a lender’s license to operate, has been cautioning bankers for some time that they need to thoroughly vet e-residents before signing them on. He has stepped up his warnings since the Danske scandal. Some 50,000-plus people hold the digital identity card but there is no public data on how many also bank in Estonia.  Erki Kilu, the chief executive of LHV bank, said that while only a small number of e-residents opened a personal bank account in Estonia, the 6,000 companies registered in the country by e-residents required an account. One quarter of those bank with LHV, he told Reuters. Kilu said e-residents were subject to the same checks as other customers who lived abroad.  In an email to Reuters, he said there were also “later screening and monitoring processes”, declining to give further details. The bank does not open accounts for people or companies subject to sanctions. Ainar Leppanen, responsible for SEB’s retail banking in Estonia, said it took a cautious approach to foreign customers without “a clear link to the country”, applying additional measures such as “background checks”. He said customers were checked against international sanctions lists and described the number of e-resident customers of SEB as “insignificant”.  A spokeswoman for Swedbank said it performed “due diligence ... to ensure that their businesses have a clear connection to Estonia” before taking on e-resident customers. Some banks, however, generally steer clear.  “We don’t see a business case here right now,” said Erkki Raasuke, chief executive of Luminor, one of the largest banks in the Baltics. “The potential downside, if some of the anti-money laundering or sanctions-related risks would materialize, can be significant.” Closer scrutiny of e-residents is part of a wider effort to curb financial crime by authorities in Estonia since the Danske scandal. In addition to the e-residency program, the country’s digital pedigree — video calling company Skype was built there – and pro-business culture have made it an attractive outpost for companies working with cryptocurrencies. It typically takes just hours and an online form to open a business in Estonia and some 600 digital currency companies are registered there. “There is a money laundering risk with cryptocurrency operators. We have made it too easy for these crypto operators now. They get a reputational benefit from their link to Estonia. We get the reputational risk,” Madis Muller, Estonia’s deputy central bank governor, told Reuters. Lawmakers are considering giving police the power to scrutinize cryptocurrency companies and withdraw their licenses if executives fail a “fit and proper” test of their reputation and ability to do the job.  Under proposals before parliament, cryptocurrency companies will also be required to have a business presence in Estonia, something that many lack. “I understand that most would not be able to comply - and would not qualify to keep their license,” said Muller. National elections in early March, however, could delay such reforms, as lawmakers would have to restart negotiations if they do not sign off the rules by February 21, when they disband. Estonia’s vision of an advanced digital society open to all is a point of pride for its 1.3 million people, many of whom remember the constraints of life under Soviet rule. Azerbaijan, which also declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, became the second country to launch an e-residency program last year.  As part of its digital branding, Estonia has gifted symbolic e-residencies to Microsoft founder Bill Gates, German chancellor Angela Merkel and Pope Francis, among others. “Digital is not 100 percent secure but it is more secure than analogue,” Estonia’s president Kersti Kaljulaid told Reuters at the presidential castle, built by Russian Czar Peter I for his wife in the early 18th century. “An e-resident bank client has passed a background check.” The Estonian police vet all applicants for e-residency, checking identity documents such as passports and examining international police records to ensure the applicant has not committed crimes overseas.  The process typically takes between four and six weeks and does not require applicants to visit. Once issued, the cards can be collected at Estonian embassies. Roughly one third of e-residents come from Finland, Russia, Ukraine and Germany, according to official data that lists one e-resident in North Korea and roughly 400 in Iran. They are not named. Others come from dozens of countries around the globe from Britain to Panama.  Madis Reimand, the head of Estonia’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the arm of the police that monitors money laundering and crypto operators, said e-residents did not pose “big risks” although he said care should be taken in vetting them.  But Reimand was critical of cryptocurrencies. “We see really big threats from virtual currencies, especially threats of fraud and money laundering.” It is a far cry from 2017, when at the height of the cryptocurrency boom, the then manager of the e-residency scheme suggested Estonia to set up its own digital means of exchange, the ‘estcoin’. In the last weeks of 2018, the number of applications for e-residency slipped, according to official data.  Although the scheme is growing year-on-year, at its current pace, it would take until 2488 to reach its original goal of 10 million people, something Estonia had set its sights on when the scheme was launched roughly four years ago.

      "3 Min Read(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Bing search engine has been blocked in China, the company said on Wednesday, making it the latest foreign technology service to be shut down behind the country’s Great Firewall. “We’ve confirmed that Bing is currently inaccessible in China and are engaged to determine next steps,” the company said in a statement. It is the U.S. technology giant’s second setback in China since November 2017 when its Skype internet phone call and messaging service was pulled from Apple and Android app stores. A search performed on Bing’s China website -  cn.bing.com - from within mainland China directs the user to a page that says the server cannot be reached. The Financial Times, citing a source, reported on Wednesday that China Unicom (0762.HK), a major state-owned telecommunication company, had confirmed the government order to block the search engine.  Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), a government watchdog, did not respond to faxed questions about Bing’s blocked website. Bing was the only major foreign search engine accessible from within China’s so-called Great Firewall. Microsoft censored search results on sensitive topics, in accordance with government policy. Microsoft also has a partnership with Chinese data center provider 21Vianet to offer its products Azure and Office 365 to clients in the country.   Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Google search platform has been blocked in China since 2010. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in December it has “no plans” to relaunch a search engine in China though it is continuing to study the idea amid increased scrutiny of big tech firms. President Xi Jinping has accelerated control of the internet in China since 2016, as the ruling Communist Party seeks to crack down on dissent in the social media landscape. In a statement on Wednesday, CAC said it had deleted more than 7 million pieces of online information and 9,382 mobile apps. It also criticized technology company Tencent’s news app for spreading “vulgar information.”  Reporting by Josh Horwitz in Shanghai and Gaurika Juneja in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Cate Cadell and Stephen Nellis; Editing by Sandra Maler, Grant McCool and Darren SchuettlerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Microsoft has “principles to build it and make sure (there are) fair and robust uses of the technology,” Nadella said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

      "3 Min Read(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Bing search engine has been blocked in China, the company said on Wednesday, making it the latest foreign technology service to be shut down behind the country’s Great Firewall. “We’ve confirmed that Bing is currently inaccessible in China and are engaged to determine next steps,” the company said in a statement. It is the U.S. technology giant’s second setback in China since November 2017 when its Skype internet phone call and messaging service was pulled from Apple and Android app stores. A search performed on Bing’s China website -  cn.bing.com - from within mainland China directs the user to a page that says the server cannot be reached. The Financial Times, citing a source, reported on Wednesday that China Unicom (0762.HK), a major state-owned telecommunication company, had confirmed the government order to block the search engine.  Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), a government watchdog, did not respond to faxed questions about Bing’s blocked website. Bing was the only major foreign search engine accessible from within China’s so-called Great Firewall. Microsoft censored search results on sensitive topics, in accordance with government policy. Microsoft also has a partnership with Chinese data center provider 21Vianet to offer its products Azure and Office 365 to clients in the country.   Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Google search platform has been blocked in China since 2010. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in December it has “no plans” to relaunch a search engine in China though it is continuing to study the idea amid increased scrutiny of big tech firms. President Xi Jinping has accelerated control of the internet in China since 2016, as the ruling Communist Party seeks to crack down on dissent in the social media landscape. In a statement on Wednesday, CAC said it had deleted more than 7 million pieces of online information and 9,382 mobile apps. It also criticized technology company Tencent’s news app for spreading “vulgar information.”  Reporting by Josh Horwitz in Shanghai and Gaurika Juneja in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Cate Cadell and Stephen Nellis; Editing by Sandra Maler, Grant McCool and Darren SchuettlerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

      "3 Min Read(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp’s Bing search engine was accessible for some internet users in mainland China late on Thursday, indicating that online access to the foreign technology service may have been restored within the country’s Great Firewall.  Bing’s website was accessible on mobile as well as broadband connections, though some users still reported occasional difficulties and it was not clear whether resumption to service was temporary or permanent. Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It said on Wednesday that Bing had been blocked in China and that it was trying to determine its next steps.

      "3 Min ReadSHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Search engine Bing’s outage in China last week was a technical error, rather than an intentional censorship block, a source familiar with the matter said, although Chinese authorities and Microsoft have not commented on the topic. From a technical perspective, a person at Microsoft Corp told Reuters, the site appeared to have been blocked in a manner similar to sites blocked by the government. But the company had received no prior notice from authorities, and the disruption was not intentional on the part of the government, added the person, who declined to be identified, citing the sensitivity of the matter.  Microsoft was not immediately available for comment on Monday. Last week, although it confirmed the outage, it declined to give details.  The Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond immediately to a faxed request from Reuters seeking comment. Starting from Thursday, Internet users in China attempting to access cn.bing.com, the search engine’s domestic URL, found themselves directed to an error page. Attempts to log on to Facebook, Google search, or other sites blocked by China’s Great Firewall, encountered the same fate.  Service had resumed by late on Friday, however. Engineers at ExpressVPN, a provider of virtual private network (VPN) software allowing internet users in China to access censored websites, ran tests during the outage to determine its origin.  They found that rather than domain name service (DNS) poisoning, the most common means for blocking sites under the Great Firewall, Bing’s outage appeared to employ a technique known as “black-holing”. With this method, rather than re-directing to a dummy server traffic headed for a specific website, the traffic is simply cut off en route, usually at the internet service provider (ISP) level. Express VPN Vice President Harold Li said blackholing boosts the likelihood of an accidental block, versus the more typical DNS poisoning, though he added that the company could not confirm the exact nature of the outage. “We have no idea if it was an accident or not, but it’s much easier to make the mistake of blocking Bing when you’re blocking a set of IP addresses,” he said, referring to website addresses. Bing has long been the only major overseas search engine accessible in China, which blocked access to Alphabet’s Google search platform starting in 2010. Microsoft alters Bing’s results to avoid politically sensitive topics, in line with government policy. Bing’s outage came a day after a widely read article by a Chinese journalist criticizing the quality of search results from Baidu Inc, the dominant domestic search engine. That led some internet users to speculate the two incidents were related. The company has endured regular public backlash since 2016, when a Chinese student died after seeking treatment at a hospital that advertised on Baidu.

      "5 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - While growing up in Seattle, Enrique Rico’s mom cleaned the posh homes of Microsoft employees. When Rico tagged along on sick days from school, he dreamed of having the life of a technology worker. Now, at 26, with no college degree or background in STEM, Rico is working a developer at Avvo, an online marketplace for legal services.  He is a graduate of a program called Apprenti that provides education and on-the-job training for tech jobs to non-traditional recruits.  “I never really thought I could do it. But once I dug deep, I gave it my all,” said Rico. The Apprenti program is run by the Washington Technology Industry Association in partnership with the U.S. Department of Labor. It operates at around 50 companies nationwide with major employers including Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N). During the first year of the program in 2017, 76 candidates went through the training, which includes about 400 to 780 classroom hours on the front end, compressed into 12 weeks.  After a year of on-the-job training, the program will finish 2018 with 330 graduates placed into full-time jobs. The class of 2019 is on track to produce more than 700 graduates.  Amazon expects its apprenticeship cohort to grow from 150 to 1,000 workers in the next few years, said Tammy Thieman, a senior program manager at the ecommerce giant. The tech industry had 2.8 million openings last year, with 50 percent of them middle-level jobs that do not necessarily require a college degree, according to Jennifer Carlson, executive director of Apprenti. The pace of hiring is lagging, however, because companies cannot find properly trained workers, she said.       “This industry needed technical competency at the start - that’s a paradigm shift from traditional apprenticeships,” Carlson added. Apprenti focuses on veterans, women and under-represented minorities, screening about 2,000 candidates to find 700 candidates for 2019. Amazon teamed up with Apprenti after its CEO Jeff Bezos made a commitment in 2016 to hire 25,000 veterans and military spouses by 2021. But the apprenticeship program quickly broadened to find qualified workers for a vast swath of open jobs that required specific credentials.    “It is not at all unrealistic that freshman going to college today come out already behind,” said Amazon’s Thieman. “An apprenticeship offers a model to do the learning in a compressed way and then learn the skills on the job.  While veterans often have valuable skills, they usually do not have a conventional resume or workplace experience. That is why the biggest challenge currently for veterans is being underemployed when they leave the armed forces, said Chris Newsome, vice president of candidate aggregation at RecruitMilitary. “A lot of these men and women are able to find jobs, but not necessarily careers,” Newsome said. New college graduates often will need to complete a program like Apprenti to be job-ready because programming languages and platforms change so quickly.  Training at universities or even specialty classes at community colleges also do not quite stack up when it comes to hiring for a role such as cloud administrators which require specific certificates, Apprenti’s Carlson said.  Even boot camps for coding do not necessarily do the trick. Rico tried that route first, quitting his $16.50-an-hour job as a salesperson at an Apple Store to go into a coding program.  But without a college degree, he did not stand much of a chance against the automated interfaces most big tech companies use to sort through applicants when hiring. For smaller companies like Avvo, Apprenti is more of a mission.  “The executives saw the value of a program that gets you talented engineers and does a social good,” said Hunter Davis, director of engineering at Avvo.  The company has about 25-30 developers currently on staff, with about 15 percent of them coming through Apprenti. “They are awesome and full of grit and willing to learn,” Davis said.  The leg up for Apprenti grads starts right away. Like Rico, many were previously working minimum wage jobs, with a median income of $28,000 and most without benefits. The starting salary in the Apprenti program is $45,000 during training.  At six months when candidates begin their on-the-job training, the salary rises $51,000. If they get hired full-time - and almost all of them do - Apprenti grads make at least $75,000. That is a life-changing salary for most of the participants.  “I have an apartment and a dog and a cat,” said Rico, who is still dreaming. “I’d love to get married and have kids and buy a house. I want to be my own boss. I would love to start my own company.” Editing by Lauren Young and G CrosseAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

      "4 Min Read(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday met Wall Street’s targets for its quarterly results and forecast, though Azure cloud computing sales grew more slowly than a year earlier. Shares of Microsoft, one of the most valuable U.S. technology companies, fell 3 percent in extended trade even though earnings per share slightly beat analysts’ estimates. The stock had closed 3.3 percent higher in a broad tech rally. Azure, Microsoft’s flagship cloud product, had revenue growth of 76 percent in the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from a 98 percent surge a year earlier. Azure sales increased 76 percent in the September quarter as well. Long known for its Windows software, Microsoft has shifted its focus to the fledgling cloud market where it is battling Amazon.com Inc for dominance. The company is rapidly picking up business from the retail industry in particular, which is aiming to keep pace with the e-commerce business of Amazon. This month alone, Microsoft announced deals with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Kroger Co, on top of a five-year agreement with Walmart Inc it unveiled this summer. “Our strong commercial cloud results reflect our deep and growing partnerships with leading companies in every industry including retail, financial services, and healthcare,” Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in a statement. But Wall Street has grown accustomed to blockbuster earnings beats as companies around the globe ditch their own data centers for the cloud. “It wasn’t a blowout quarter,” said analyst Shannon Cross of Cross Research. “That’s probably playing a bit into” the stock decline. Microsoft forecast revenue of between $29.4 billion and $30.1 billion in the current quarter. Analysts were expecting  $29.9 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company also said a stronger U.S. dollar would hit growth of its intelligent cloud business segment, which includes Azure and other products, by 2 percentage points. Microsoft has long courted customers outside the United States and has a 17 percent share of the global cloud market, research firm Canalys previously said. Amazon has 32 percent. Microsoft is spending more on the latest cloud technologies to narrow the gap. Research and development expenses rose to $4.1 billion in the quarter from $3.5 billion a year earlier. “Clearly the company is spending aggressively to double down on its cloud bet, a dynamic that is a smart move but caps margin upside in the quarter,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. Microsoft’s total revenue climbed 12.3 percent to $32.47 billion. Wall Street analysts on average had expected revenue of $32.51 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue from Microsoft’s productivity software unit climbed 13 percent to $10.1 billion, powered by double-digit revenue growth for LinkedIn and Office 365. Wall Street analysts on average had expected revenue of $10.09 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Microsoft’s personal computing division, home to Windows software and still its largest by revenue, showed revenue growth of 7 percent to $13 billion, while analysts had expected $13.07 billion. The unit also includes Xbox gaming consoles, the Bing online search service and Surface laptops. Microsoft reported a profit of $8.42 billion. Excluding one-time items, it earned $1.10 per share, edging past analysts’ estimates of $1.09 per share.
